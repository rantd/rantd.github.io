### Riemannian Geometry
We consider a two-dimensional Riemannian geometry consisting of two elements:
* a two-dimensional manifold: a set of points parametrized smoothly by two coordinates $$x=(x^0,x^1)$$.
* a rule for distance $$\Delta l$$ between each pair of neighboring points with coordinate differences $\Delta x^{\alpha}$, which is expressed as a quadratic form $$(\Delta l)^2=\sum_{\mu,v=0}^1g_{\mu v}(x)\Delta x^{\mu}\Delta x^{v}$$. A manifold with a rule for distance in the previous form is called a _Riemannian manifold_.

Depending on the explicit form of $$g_{\mu v}(x)$$, we can obtain the different manifolds. For instance, if

$$
g(x)=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
$$

then the manifold is a Euclidean plane which has line element $$(\Delta l)^2=(\Delta x^0)^2+(\Delta x^1)^2$$.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
    std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        /* code */
    }
    return 0;
}
```
